= DDEV Buildpacks

Common repository for DDEV buildpacks. This aims to match 
link:https://github.com/drud/ddev[ddev] tool for cloud deployments and provide
tools for seamless transition from local development to live deployment.

== Project Status
DDEV buildpacks are currently alpha, and are under active development. Breaking
changes to the API and behavior between the releases can be expected.

link:stacks[stacks], and link:builders[builders]. A pre-requisite is installed 
link:https://buildpacks.io/[pack]. In order to build the stacks and builders 
locally for development purposes, you can invoke `make`
```
$ make stacks builders
...
Successfully created builder image ddev/php-builder:7.3
